BlackJack Blastoff

Java program to play Blackjack and learn card counting. 

I am providing source in case anyone would care to verify the correct implementation of the card counting strategies.

I am providing a little more, the barely begun PDF doc, that might be of interest to users of the code.

More might follow if there is any interest indicated in this. For instance if anyone actually wants to build. 
It is an Eclipse project for me but I could probably come up with a working ant build.
